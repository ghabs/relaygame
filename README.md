### Overview

The Relay Game is a collaborative programming experiment, designed to see how groups of people with limited time can asynchronously work together to factor and solve problems.

The goal is to solve a programming problem, like one you might encounter in an interview. The bad news is you only have ten minutes to understand the problem, brainstorm a strategy, and code up your solution. The good news is you have a bunch of other people who also have ten minutes to contribute to solving the problem. 

You'll have access to the code and the notes written by the previous player. In your ten minute window you can do whatever you like: 
- Write code
- Write instructions for the next player (who may or may not follow them)
- Think up approaches to the problem
- Brainstorm meta strategies for how the next player should effectively communicate with future players

At the end of the ten minute block you'll submit your notes and code, and when the next player's turn begins they'll take what you've created and improve on.

### The Rules

- You have ten minutes to work on the problem. 

- Before the ten minutes is up you may submit a form with any notes. Those notes will be seen by the next player. After ten minutes no submissions will be allowed.

- You'll be provided an online Python workspace that will automatically be shared with the next participant. 

- You can use any external tools you want, though you may not explicitly google search for the answer to the problem.
   - Ex. Searching for how to use Sets in Python is good, searching for the specific problem posed to you is bad.
